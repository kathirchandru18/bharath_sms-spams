MS Spam Classification üì±‚úâÔ∏è
Overview
This project focuses on building an SMS Spam Classifier that categorizes SMS messages as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam). By leveraging machine learning algorithms and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the classifier helps filter out unwanted spam messages.

Project Structure
The project includes the following components:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming text data using NLP techniques.
Feature Engineering: Extracting features like TF-IDF vectors from the text.
Model Training: Building and evaluating machine learning models to classify SMS messages.
Visualization: Using Matplotlib to visualize message distribution and model performance.
Libraries Used
NumPy: Efficient numerical operations and data manipulation.
Pandas: Data handling and preprocessing.
Matplotlib: Data visualization for insights and model performance.
scikit-learn: Machine learning model building and evaluation.
NLTK/Spacy: (If used) For text preprocessing like tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization.
Dataset
The dataset used is from [insert dataset source]. It contains two columns:

Label: "spam" or "ham" to indicate whether the message is spam or not.
Message: The text of the SMS message.
Features
Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization.
Feature Extraction: TF-IDF vectorizer for text representation.
Models Used: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.
Model Evaluation: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
